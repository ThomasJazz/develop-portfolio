This is the first program I've written outside of school that actually has a UI.
It is coded entirely in Java besides some of the button styling and alignment
which was done in CSS. I've uploaded the current version (1.1) of this program but there will be
more updates in the future.

What does it do?
It calculates the percentage chance of a stat rolling on a given item as well as 
the likelihood of "profitability" for items in the game Path of Exile.
